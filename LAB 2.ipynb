Outside of the data in this lab, I learned that 3 pieces of data out of a 47,000 data set wouldn't allow my code to run. I also learned all of the hard work that goes into making a lab such as this. \n",

Finally, thanks Theo for responding to my snapchat and helping me try and figure out why my code wasn't working. Another huge shoutout to Ms. Sconyers for literally taking her entire free period to help me figure out what was wrong with my file. It took a very long time but I am very thankful for her time and her patience when it wouldn't work. Also, thank you to Ms. Sconyers for teaching me some new code that we will need for the data cleaning lab!  "
